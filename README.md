# LearningProject
  This package is just a playground for learning about neural networks. The idea
  is to make a feed-forward back-propagational neural network. The test case	
  will be separation of gluon-fusion produced Higgs to gamma gamma signals 
  from non-resonant diphoton backgrounds.

## Axon
   A basic class for representing a directed weighted connection between two 
   nodes.

## Neuron
   A basic class for representing network nodes. This includes the activation
   function, the incoming connections, and the outgoing connections.

## NeuralNetwork
   A class for creating a network with a given number of variables, a given 
   number of hidden layers, and a given number of nodes per hidden layer.
